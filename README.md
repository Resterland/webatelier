# webatelier

This repository is for me to learn how to set-up TYPO3 based pojects.

## Create new Project

$ mkdir YourNewProjectFolder

$ cd YourNewProjectFolder

$ composer install resterland/webatelier

This will install TYPO3 with system extensions I usually need
as well as followin extensions:
- causal/image_autoresize
- bk2k/bootstrap-package 
- resterland/resterland
- resterland/rlkickstart
